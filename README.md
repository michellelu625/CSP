# AP Computer Science Principles – Python Projects

This repository contains a curated collection of Python programs I developed during my AP Computer Science Principles coursework in high school. These projects reflect my early foundation in programming, algorithmic thinking, and user-focused software design, and they represent the starting point of my continued growth in computer science.

## What this repository demonstrates

- Core programming fundamentals: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and data structures  
- Practical use of Python lists, strings, and built-in methods  
- Interactive, user-driven programs with input validation and control flow  
- Breaking larger problems into smaller, testable functions  
- Logical reasoning and step-by-step problem solving

## Project highlights

- List and string manipulation exercises (slicing, indexing, aggregation)  
- Interactive number-guessing game with attempt tracking and median calculation  
- Classroom inventory management system supporting add, remove, display, and count operations  
- License plate processing and string transformation logic  

Each project was written independently and emphasizes clarity, correctness, and readability.

## Why this matters

While these projects were completed early in my CS journey, they represent the foundation of how I approach software development today: understanding the problem, designing clean logic, and writing code that is easy to follow and extend. Since completing this coursework, I have continued to build on these fundamentals through more advanced coursework and applied projects.

## Technologies used

- Python  
- Console-based input/output  
- Fundamental data structures and control flow
